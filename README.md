# Weather App

## Description

This is a simple weather app that retrieves real-time weather information for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application displays the current temperature, feels-like temperature, weather conditions, and temperature variation (min and max).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git

## API Configuration
Make sure to replace the placeholder API key with your own OpenWeatherMap API key in the script.js file:

```bash
const api = {
    endpoint: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/",
    key: "your-api-key-here"
};
